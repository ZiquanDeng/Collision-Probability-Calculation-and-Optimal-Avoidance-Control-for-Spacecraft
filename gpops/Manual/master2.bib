Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of the optimal coplanar
   aeroassisted orbital transfer of a spacecraft from a high Earth orbit
   to a low Earth orbit. It is assumed that the initial and final orbits
   are circular and that the gravitational field is central and is
   governed by the inverse square law. The whole trajectory is assumed to
   consist of two impulsive velocity changes at the begin and end of one
   interior atmospheric subarc, where the vehicle is controlled via the
   lift coefficient.
   The problem is reduced to the atmospheric part of the trajectory, thus
   arriving at an optimal control problem with free final time and lift
   coefficient as the only (bounded) control variable. For this problem,
   the necessary conditions of optimal control theory are derived.
   Applying multiple shooting techniques, two trajectories with different
   control structures are computed. The first trajectory is characterized
   by a lift coefficient at its minimum value during the whole atmospheric
   pass. For the second trajectory, an optimal control history with a
   boundary subarc followed by a free subarc is chosen. It turns out, that
   this second trajectory satisfies the minimum principle, whereas the
   first one fails to satisfy this necessary condition; nevertheless, the
   characteristic velocities of the two trajectories differ only in the
   sixth significant digit.
   In the second part of the paper, the assumption of impulsive velocity
   changes is dropped. Instead, a more realistic modeling with two
   finite-thrust subarcs in the nonatmospheric part of the trajectory is
   considered. The resulting optimal control problem now describes the
   whole maneuver including the nonatmospheric parts. It contains as
   control variables the thrust, thrust angle, and lift coefficient.
   Further, the mass of the vehicle is treated as an additional state
   variable. For this optimal control problem, numerical solutions are
   presented. They are compared with the solutions of the impulsive model.}},

Abstract = {{Two fuel-minimal aeroassisted orbital transfers are examined, Transfers
   from geosynchronous orbit to a low Earth orbit are considered, Instead
   of assuming an impulsive thrust on initial and final orbit, limited
   thrust on a nonvanishing interval on each orbit is introduced. In the
   atmospheric part, the transfer vehicle is controlled via the lift
   coefficient. The influence of Earth's rotation is considered also.
   Whereas in the atmospheric part an Earth-fixed frame of reference is
   used, the nonatmospheric parts are considered in an inertial frame of
   reference. This leads to an optimal control problem with well-defined
   jumps in the state and adjoint variables at the junction points between
   atmospheric and nonatmospheric arcs, The necessary conditions,
   including adjoint differential equations, boundary and interior point
   conditions, and control conditions, are derived to set up a boundary;

   thrust with Earth's rotation, first neglected and later included, are

Journal = {Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-34}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In order to solve nonplanar LEO-LEO aeroassisted space
   rendezvous, this paper aims to study an active phasing method based on
   orbital preliminary adjusting scheme out of atmosphere.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to add atmospheric entry
   velocity; orbital preliminary adjusting out of atmosphere is presented
   and the orbital altitude of high earth orbit (HEO) is selected
   eclectically. Nonplanar HEO-LEO aeroassisted orbital transfer problem
   is studied in detail. According to the standard atmospheric flight
   trajectory; the locations of deorbit points in HEO are determined and
   the standard phase angle between orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) in HEO
   and target in low earth orbit (LEO) is obtained so that ON and target
   meet space rendezvous demand. Finally, the active phasing method is
   studied so that the standard phase angle can be satisfied when OTV is
   transferred to HEO. So space rendezvous can be realized under the help
   of aeroassisted orbital transfer technique once the standard phase
   angle is satisfied.
   Findings - Nonplanar LEO-LEO orbital transfer depending on entirely
   propulsive will use enormous fuel and the phasing problem will be most
   difficult in nonplanar LEO-LEO space rendezvous mission. However, the
   fuel consumption can be saved and rendezvous mission can be finished in
   an advisable time when nonplanar LEO-LEO aeroassisted orbital transfer
   technology is applied properly.
   Originality/value - Aeroassisted space rendezvous method is presented
   in this paper. Orbital preliminary adjusting out of atmosphere is
   studied in order to add atmospheric entry velocity and the active
   phasing method for realizing space rendezvous is integrated in
   preliminary adjusting scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about an optimization method which has been developed to 
   deal with trajectory optimization and mission analysis of an
   aeroassisted orbital transfer vehicle (OTV), in the context of
   preliminary design studies. Although this kind of trajectory can
   already be computed with existing trajectory optimization tools, we
   need a faster and robust tool which can be integrated as a ``black
   box{''} in a multidisciplinary design process, in order to study
   rapidly many different OTV concepts and missions. In this context, our
   objective is not to get a very precise ``optimal trajectory{''}, as
   existing ``heavy{''} optimization tools do, but a solution precise
   enough to give a good insight of the performance (namely, the apogee
   altitude variation) and the mechanical and thermal loads. Incidentally,
   the solution obtained may also be used as an initial guess for a more
   precise trajectory optimization tool. To achieve this goal, we have
   studied parametric formulations of the control law, with optimization
   of the switching times. This development has been done considering a
   low lift-to-drag ratio vehicle (controlled only with the bank angle),
   like the aerocapture-designed version of the Mars Sample Return
   Orbiter. The cost function to be minimized is the heat flux, which is a
   key parameter for the multidisciplinary design of this kind of vehicle.
   The parametric formulation eventually chosen yields a good level of
   precision and robustness. Also, the study has been pushed further with
   the optimization of some mission parameters in the same process, in
   order to get directly preliminary answers to some trade-off issues in
   the mission analysis, like the choice of the initial perigee altitude.

   transportation systems for new kinds of missions such as on-orbit
   servicing (OOS), payload ferrying, or in-situ observation of
   space-debris. Using simplified models and an appropriate low-dimension
   formulation for the optimization problem the method makes possible to
   obtain rapidly and easily a global view of the trade-off between the
   payload mass and the total mass. It also makes possible to discuss the
   feasibility of the vehicle with regard to different multidisciplinary
   constraints and technology hypotheses for the heat shield. This
   approach is illustrated by eight different AOTV design studies,
   considering two different missions (LEO-MEO and LEO-GEO), two different
   propulsion technologies (LOX-LH2 and LOX-CH4) and two different thermal
   protection system (TPS) characteristics. In each case, we discuss the
   feasibility and characteristics of the lightest vehicle carrying a
   prescribed 100kg payload, and, conversely, a heavy vehicle with a
   prescribed 18 ton total mass, carrying the heaviest possible payload.

         is, a program transformation k nown as automatic differentiation is performed to change the
         semantics of a program in a fashion based on the chain rule of differential calculus. Th e crucial
         ingredient of the tool is a combination of source-to-source trans formation and operator

         differences (DD) have been used traditionally for functions defined by (potentially very complex)
         computer programs , even if only approximate values can be obtained this way. An alternative
         approach for such functions is automatic different iation (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often

   Single revolution coplanar and plane change trajectories are

   the orbit, and the objective of the plane change trajectory is to
   maximize the reduction in orbital inclination. Optimal trajectories are
   presented for both cases to show the benefits of combining atmospheric

         operator overloading on variables of the class {\tt fmad}. The main distinguishing feature of
         this MATLAB implementation is the separation of the linear combination of derivative vectors into a
         separate derivative vector class {\tt derivvec}. This allows for the straightforward
         performance optimisation of the overall package. Additionally by internally using a matrix
         (two-dimensional) representation of arbitrary dimension directional derivatives we may utilise
         MATLAB's sparse matrix class to propagate sparse directional derivatives for MATLAB code which
         uses arbitrary dimension arrays. On several examples the package is shown to be more efficient than
         Verma's ADMAT package.",

Abstract = {{Aeroassisted orbital transfer is recognized as a potential technology
   to enhance operational responsiveness in space with significant fuel
   savings. To endure aerodynamic heating resulting from the flight
   through the atmosphere, however, considerable thermal protection is
   required, thereby potentially decreasing the mass savings due to lower
   fuel consumption. In this paper, the relationship between achievable
   fuel savings and thermal protection system size is investigated by
   coupling trajectory optimization and thermal protection system design
   through the single parameter of maximum heating rate constraint. The
   optimal solution that minimizes the total mass of fuel and the thermal
   protection system is then determined. A trajectory optimization
   procedure and a thermal protection system mass estimation model are
   then applied to the transfer of a vehicle between two low-Earth orbits
   with a specified inclination change. All trajectory parameters,
   including deorbit, boost, and recircularization impulses, are optimized
   and the thermal protection system is sized with ablative and reusable
   materials. It is found that the minimum overall mass (fuel and thermal
   protection system) is achieved when no heating rate constraint is
   imposed, which is also the scenario that minimizes the fuel consumption
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose is to study the general problem of aerodynamic maneuvers at
   low altitudes while at orbital speed. The spacecraft's trajectory
   changes are generated by the applied lift and drag aerodynamic forces.
   Employing an adequate model of the aerodynamic forces function of the
   angle of attack, the unbounded angle of attack is used as the control
   variable. To perform a general analysis of spacecraft trajectories when
   employing aerodynamic forces, the aeroassisted attainability domain is
   studied. Specifically, given the initial position and velocity of the
   vehicle at atmospheric entry, the region in state space that can be
   attained by the vehicle at atmospheric exit when using all of the
   possible controls at its disposal is determined. The set of
   trajectories belonging to the boundary of the attainability domain is
   obtained through the variation of a single parameter, namely, the
   initial value of angle of attack at atmospheric entry. The trajectories
   are obtained by a forward integration of the state and adjoint
   equations of motion. Representative results of the attainability domain
   for given initial conditions and vehicle characteristics are presented.}},

         directional derivatives (``tangent mode'') and gradients (``reverse mode'').
         This report summarizes the mathematical justifications of Automatic Differentiation, then describes
         in full detail the differentiation model that TAPENADE implements. Our goal is to give the users of
         TAPENADE a precise understanding of the actions and choices made while differentiating programs, so
         as to improve their confidence in the produced source programs. This report documents all the
         available options and parameterizations that the users can give to TAPENADE, and conversely all the
         diagnosis and requirements that TAPENADE may issue towards the users. After a brief description of
         TAPENADE's architecture and performances, this report describes more fully the validation and

Abstract = {{An explicit guidance of aeroassisted orbital transfer by using the
   method of matched asymptotic expansions is presented. The aeroassisted
   orbit transfer comprises three consecutive phases: a descending phase
   entering atmosphere with a negative flight path angle, a
   transatmospheric flight to deplete its excess energy, and an ascending
   flight targeting the desired apogee. Feedback control via lift
   modulation is used to guide the vehicle during the atmospheric
   fly-through, whereas a matched asymptotic solution for the exit
   trajectory is available to aim the apogee of the target orbit, thus
   determining the pull-up condition. The feedback control ensures the
   stability of a trajectory around the nominal trajectory by compensating
   for the nonlinear terms in the motion of the vehicle. When the method
   of matched asymptotic expansions is used, the control algorithms for
   the explicit guidance are derived and tested against the 1976 U.S.
   Standard Atmosphere. Simulation results indicate that the control
   algorithms can effectively control the trajectories in both the lower
   atmosphere and in the exit phase under the targeting dispersions of
   atmospheric variations.}},

Abstract = {{Aeroassisted orbital transfer (AOT) combines space maneuvers and
   atmospheric maneuvers so as to achieve propellant savings vis-a-vis
   purely propulsive maneuvers, albeit at the expense of high heating
   rates during the atmospheric pass. Of critical importance is the study
   of optimal trajectories; equally important is the development of
   guidance schemes in view of the precision requirements of AOT
   trajectories and the need for coping with various sources of dispersion
   effects.
   In this lecture, optimal trajectories are reviewed with reference to
   angle of bank control. Trajectories are optimized from the point of
   view of performance and control margin: Compromise trajectories are
   generated from a trade-off between performance and control margin.
   The ultimate goal is to arrive at practical AOT guidance trajectories
   exhibiting many of the desirable characteristics of AOT optimal
   trajectories. Guidance advances are reviewed with reference to angle of
   bank control, in particular, safety zone exit guidance and complete
   entry/exit guidance. Continuation of research efforts in the area of
   guidance is important, indeed essential, for the future development of
   AOT vehicles. In particular, the use of parallel computation for
   real-time guidance is worthy of investigation. Copyright (C) 1996

Title = {{Near-Optimal Guidance Scheme for a Mars Trajectory}},
Journal = {Acta Astronautica},
Year = {{2002}},

Number = {{1--9}},
Pages = {{351-378}},
Month = {July--November},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with a near-optimal guidance scheme for a spacecraft
   flying from a low Earth orbit (LEO) to a low Mars orbit (LMO). The
   importance of guidance can be understood from the following
   consideration: a small error in the launch velocity at LEO can induce a
   very large position error on arrival at LMO due to error propagation
   associated with the large flight time and distance. Indeed, the
   uncertainties and errors in the thrust, system equations, and
   measurements constitute a special challenge to the designer of the
   guidance and control for a Mars mission.
   On account of the large changes in the gravitational field near a
   planet, the guidance design has three phases: near-Earth phase,
   interplanetary phase, and near-Mars phase. The focus of this paper is
   on guidance for the interplanetary phase. We assume that chemical
   engines are used and that the control is implemented by changing the
   magnitude and/or direction of the thrust via propellant consumption.
   A detector-predictor-corrector scheme is developed for guidance and
   control. The detector computes the spacecraft trajectory from the
   current measured state, estimating the trajectory error in the
   neighborhood of the low Mars orbit. The predictor is activated when the
   trajectory error exceeds a specified threshold. The task of the
   predictor is to generate a velocity correction, hence a thrust input,
   such that the target trajectory (the trajectory after the velocity
   correction) can rendezvous with the low Mars orbit. The corrector is a
   feedback control scheme to implement the control commands from the
   predictor.
   The key to the guidance design is the predictor. The maximum control
   margin concept is used in the predictor design to enhance the guidance
   robustness. Application of this concept means that the target
   trajectory for rendezvous with the low Mars orbit is to be achieved
   with minimum propellant consumption. The sequential gradient
   restoration algorithm (SGRA) is used in conjunction with system
   decomposition to achieve the real-time implementation of the guidance,
   and the target trajectory is computed via a two-step process, which
   includes target restoration followed by velocity restoration. The
   objective of the target restoration is to generate a trajectory leading
   from the current position to rendezvous with the low Mars orbit with
   the minimum velocity change w.r.t. the current velocity; the objective
   of the velocity restoration is to achieve the required velocity change
   via proper thrust input to the spacecraft. Considerable enhancement of
   SGRA for robustness, convergence, and speed can be achieved via this
   decomposition.
   Preliminary numerical results are encouraging. They show that the above
   detector-predictor-corrector scheme can achieve safely the rendezvous
   with the low Mars orbit, while containing the propellant consumption
   due to the errors and uncertainties in the thrust, system, and
   measurements. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{A synergetic maneuver can accomplish orbital plane changes with less
   fuel than an exoatmospheric maneuver. During the atmospheric pass, the
   spacecraft is subjected to very high heating rates, and any extra
   thermal protection required may offset the fuel savings. A
   heating-rate-constrained synergetic maneuver called aerocruise has been
   widely studied as a means for lowering the weight of the thermal
   protection system. We question the optimality of the aerocruise
   maneuver by considering the necessary and sufficient condition for a
   trajectory to remain on the heating-rate boundary. By replacing the
   aerocruise-powered turn by a maximum thrust maneuver that we call
   aerobang, a perturbed synergetic maneuver is obtained. This maneuver is
   compared against the numerically optimized aerocruise maneuver for the
   entry research vehicle. The results demonstrate that the aerobang
   maneuver consistently yields improved performance, i.e., inclination
   change per fuel mass, over the aerocruise maneuver by as much as 14\%.
   This result indicates that the optimal synergetic maneuver is yet to be
   determined and could very well be more complicated than a simple
   aerocruise turn.}},

   principle are generated for the atmospheric part of an aeroassisted
   orbital transfer problem, At the initial time all states are given. At
   the final time the altitude, velocity, and inclination change are
   prescribed. Additionally, the trajectory is subject to a heating rate
   limit, which, in the context of optimal control, represents a
   first-order state inequality constraint. Numerical difficulties implied
   by the singularly perturbed nature of the problem are avoided by
   starting the integration in the interior of the trajectory at a point
   where the heating rate limit is active, The state constraint becomes
   active always in the form of a state constrained are Nontrivial touch
   points have not been observed in numerical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{In his classical paper on the ``Schematic Study of Long-Range
   Semi-Ballistic Trajectories', Pierre Contensou has proposed a type of
   entry trajectory which consists of a series of skip sub-area,
   intercalating with Keplerian sub-arcs in the vacuum. It has been
   suggested that under favorable conditions, using this trajectory, the
   range can be extended as compared with the pure atmospheric glide mode.
   Another possible application of this type of multiple-skip trajectory
   is to use it for the rotation of the line of apsides in aeroassisted
   orbital transfer. In this paper, we shall present the extensive
   numerical results obtained in the study of the general problem of
   multiple-skip trajectories with specified range. By using a modified
   set of dimensionless variables-and a new set of adjoint variables, the
   variational problem consists of integrating a set of five non-linear
   differential equations subject to end-constraints. It is found that for
   low entry speed, the maximum range problem exhibits the typical phugoid
   motion in pure atmospheric glide, while with high entry speed, a
   multiple-skip trajectory can be used to extend the range as predicted
   by Contensou. When the multiple-skip trajectory is used to rotate the
   line of apsides of elliptic orbit, the new solution shows significant
   fuel saving as compared with the case where only one atmospheric
   passage is considered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights
