The code "AD" was written in order to support the  Gauss Pseudospectral
Optimal Control Program (GPOPS) project.  GPOPS solves multiple-phase 
optimal control problems using the Gauss Pseudospectral Method.  The AD 
code was written in 2009 by Ilyssa Sanders and Anil V. Rao of The
University of Florida.  Currently, AD implements the forward mode for
automatic differentiation of first derivatives on a reasonable number
of commonly used functions in MATLAB.  The plans are to implement as
many MATLAB functions as possible and to include the ability to
compute second derivatives.
