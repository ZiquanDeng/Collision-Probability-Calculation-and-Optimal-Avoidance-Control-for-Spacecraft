GPOPS is a general-purpose MATLAB software for solving multiple-phase
nonlinear optimal control controls.

WARRANTY:  This software comes with absolutely no warranty that it
will work for any particular purpose.  Furthermore, the author is not

software in any application and assumes no responsibility whatsoever
for any damage caused by the use of the software or any derivative
software.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
GPOPS is an OPEN-SOURCE pseudospectral optimal control software.  
GPOPS was written by the authors beginning in 2008.  The GPOPS code 
has been written by the authors and all algorithms used in GPOPS are 
taken from the open literature.  No proprietary, confidential, or 
otherwise restricted information has been knowingly used by any of
the authors in the creation or development of GPOPS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS:  GPOPS is now self-contained and does
not require any third-party products (with the single exception of 
MATLAB itself).  

RECOMMENDED THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS:  While not required, to improve 
performance it is highly recommended that users obtain the automatic 
differentiation package INTLAB.  INTLAB is available for internal or 
non-commercial use by visiting the website 
http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/rump/intlab/.  Commercial or other use 
of INTLAB requires a license for which you must contact Professor 
Siegfried Rump at rump@tu-harburg.de.
