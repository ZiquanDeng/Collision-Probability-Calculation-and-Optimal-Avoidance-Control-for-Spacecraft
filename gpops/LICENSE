% to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change       %
% software.  If anyone wonders about the meaning of the GPOPS      %
% License, they should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0.    %

% Restrictions for Use and Distribution of GPOPS:                  %
%     * GPOPS is a completely FREE software both for use and for   %
%       redistribution.  Furthermore, while it may be used within  %
%       commercial organizations, it is not for sale or resale     %
%     * The only exception to the sales restriction above is that  %
%       GPOPS may be included as a part of a free open-source      %
%       software such as Linux operating systems.  When            %
%       distributing GPOPS with free operating systems, no fee     %
%       beyond the price of the operating system itself may be     %
%       added (i.e., you cannot profit from the redistribution of  %
%       GPOPS).                                                    %
%     * GPOPS is not for commercial use with the exception that it %
%       may be used by commercial organizations for internal       %
%       research and development.  Any use of GPOPS by commercial  %
%       organizations that involve the presentation of results for %
%       profit-making purposes is strictly prohibited.             %
%                                                                  %

%     * You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;                   %
%     * If the software damages you in any way, you may only       %
%       recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it    %
%       (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not    %
%       recover any other damages, including those called          %
%       "consequential damages." (The state or country where you   %
%       live may not allow you to limit your liability in this     %

%     * You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms %
%       (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);   %
